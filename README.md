# Advent of Code - 2022
Let's see how far I can get without using libraries other than `base`.  
**Update**: I'm using `vector` for day 12 and `containers` for day 14.

Will probably rewrite (parts of) this in Rust at some point
because I want to learn that language.

Also some of the solutions are horrendously slow lol.
